# resume

Generate resume as png/pdf using template (single paged that was found from Tiktok)

Generated Sample:
<img src="sample/sample.png" alt="demo" width="500px">


## How to use:

- On first launch (or expected files are missing), the application will generate 2 files
    - resume.json -> user's resume data
    - preference.json -> preference, like theme, sizing, etc
- Modify file then press refresh button or relaunch the application
- Remark: for windows, default location for in/out files are `Documents`


## TODO:

- Better sample preference.json
- Watch files
- Adjusting configurables based on feedback
