# resume

Generate resume as png/pdf using template (single paged template, that was found from Tiktok)

Generated Sample:<br/>
<img src="sample/zh/sample.png" alt="demo" width="400px">
<img src="sample/en/sample.png" alt="demo" width="400px">


## How to use:

- On first launch (or expected files are missing), the application will generate 2 files
    - resume.json -> user's resume data, most case only need to modify this file
    - preference.json -> preference, like theme, spacing, sizing, etc
- Modify file then press refresh button or relaunch the application
- For windows, default location for files is `Documents


## TODO:

- Error message on error (and also json validation)
- Docs on schema
- Windows sizing issue
- Watch files
- Adjusting configurables based on feedback
